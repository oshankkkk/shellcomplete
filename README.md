# How things i notice as i Go

## How bubble tea works 
> Bubble tea is a Go framework like react but for the terminal
> There is a event loop that runs and thats our app
> There are 3 functions int, update and view which runs on the startup, when an event happen and the state of the app
> There is a struct called model in go, thats our app essentialy, it can have our app data like state variables and what not

### Werid UTF shenanagans
### Structs and Methods, not classes
> Go uses Structs and Methods like a method is a func that accepts arguments struct.
